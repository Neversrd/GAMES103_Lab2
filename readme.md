# GAMES103 Lab2
![SampelScene](./img/cloth_simulation.gif)

This is a simple cloth simulation. Two different methods (implict integration and PBD) are used to solve.
## Instruction
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the Lab2.uproject with Unreal Engine (4.26.0+).
2. Open the ```ImplicitModelMap.umap``` or ```PBDModelMap.umap```.
3. Click ```Play``` button and drag the read ball to hit the cloth.
## Bonus
The ```UPreviewMeshComponent``` is created to render custom mesh with which users can modify the positions of vertices directly (not through modifying the FTransform).
